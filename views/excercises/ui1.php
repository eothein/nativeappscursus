            <p>In this lesson we will recreate the famous 2048 Game. 2048 is a 
                single-player puzzle game in which the objective is to slide 
                numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile 
                with the number 2048.</p>

                In this excercise we will create a welcome screen for the application. It should contain 
                4 buttons (as shown in the example below).
                <ul>
                    <li>Continue : continue playing the current game</li>
                    <li>New Game : starts a new game</li>
                    <li>About: gives use some background information about the game</li>
                    <li>Exit : exits the game</li>
                </ul>
                To do this, create a new project and call it oefening1. Follow the next steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>Create an Activity and call it Welcome</li>
                    <li>Create the required strings in the string.xml file (the options)</li>
                    <li>Use a linear layout and add the required buttons. Make sure the correct text is 
                        displayed from strings.xml. Provide appropriate names for the id's.</li>
                    <li>Use padding to make the buttons more appealing.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now try to run it on your emulator. What happens? Is everything still visible?</p>
                <p>You can have two versions of every layout. The trick is to create a new directory 
                    under your /res folder titled: layout-land (you can do this with a right click).
                    Any xml files found in the layout-land 
                    folder will be used when the activity restarts and determines the phone to be in landscape orientation.</p>
                <h2 id="section-two">Excercise 2: Adding a layout for landscope mode</h2>
                <p> Create an alternate layout resource file and use a table layout for 
                    the buttons. To find more information on tablelayout, click <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/grid.html">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>What Are DPI's and Sps?</h3>
                <p>Historically, programmers always designed computer interfaces
                    in terms of pixels. For example, you might make a field 300 pixels
                    wide, allow 5 pixels of spacing between columns and define
                    icons 16-by-16 pixels in size. The problem is that if you run that
                    program on new displays with more and more dots per inch
                    (dpi), the user interface appears smaller and smaller. At some
                    point, it becomes too hard to read.
                    Resolution-independentmeasurements help solve this problem.
                    Android supports all the following units:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>px (pixels): Dots on the screen.</li>
                    <li> in (inches): Size as measured by a ruler.</li>
                    <li>mm (millimeters): Size as measured by a ruler.</li>
                    <li> pt (points): 1/72 of an inch.</li>
                    <li>dp (density-independent pixels): An abstract unit based
                        on the density of the screen. On a display with 160 dots
                        per inch, 1dp = 1px.</li>
                    <li> dip: Synonymfor dp, usedmore often in Google examples.</li>
                    <li> sp (scale-independent pixels): Similar to dp but also scaled
                        by the userâ€™s font size preference.</li>

                <p>There are many third-party libraries for Android and several of them are so powerful that
                    we are already going to use them in the early stages of this course.</p>
                <p>The first library we are going to use is <a href='http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/'>ButterKnife</a>. It has multiple purposes
                    but the one we are going to use is eliminating the findViewById calls by using @Bind on fields.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First we need to add ButterKnife as a dependency to our project.</li>
                    <li>Goto File -> Project -> App and select the tab Dependencies</li>
                    <li>Press '+' with Library Dependency</li>
                    <li>Look for Butterknife</li>
                    <li>Add com.jakewharton:butterknife:7.0.1 as your dependency</li>
                </ol>
                In build.gradle (module app) you should find

    compile 'com.jakewharton:butterknife:7.0.1'

                <h3>Use Butterknife</h3>
                <p>Annotate fields with @Bind and a view ID for Butter Knife to find and automatically cast 
                    the corresponding view from your layout. Don't forget ButterKnife.bind(this); in the onCreate method.</p>
                <p>Create a separate method and bind the onClick event to that methode. There's no need for a private inner class.</p>

                we are going to add this functionality to the exit button in the home screen. Use butterknife and
